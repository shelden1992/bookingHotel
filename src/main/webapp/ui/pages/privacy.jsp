            First things first – your privacy is important to us. We know that’s the kind of thing all these sorts of
            notices say, but frankly we mean it. You’ve placed your trust in us by using the booking-hotel.com services and we
            value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us.
            We act in our customers’ interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            This document describes how we use and process your personal data, hopefully provided in a readable and
            transparent manner so you can get where we’re coming from without getting bored senseless. As an added
            bonus, it also tells you how to contact us if you have questions about your personal data, which we’re more
            than happy to answer.
            Please also read our separate Cookie Statement, which tells you how booking-hotel.com makes use of cookies and
            other similar technologies. For a better understanding of what we mean by “Trip”, “Trip Provider”, “Trip
            Service” and “Trip Reservation”, please read the booking-hotel.com Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            If you’ve ever used us before, you’ll know that booking-hotel.com offers online travel-related services through
            our own websites and mobile apps, as well as through other online platforms such as partners’ websites and
            social media.
            Why point that out, you ask? Well, here’s the thing. All the information that follows applies to not one,
            not two, but all of these platforms. Several platforms, one privacy statement.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            This one privacy statement applies to any kind of information we collect through these platforms or other
            means connected to these platforms (such as contacting our customer service team via email). It makes for a
            lot less tedious reading. If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our Privacy
            Statement for Business Partners to understand how personal data is further processed as part of the business
            relationship.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time. If you care about your privacy, visit this page
            regularly and you’ll know exactly where you stand. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement which will
            have an impact on you (for example, if we intend to process your personal data for other purposes than
            communicated in the past in this Privacy Statement), we will notify you of these changes before the new
            activities begin.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Sad but necessary bit: If you disagree with this Privacy Statement, you should discontinue using our
            services. If you agree with our Privacy Statement, then you’re all set to book your next Trip through us.
            Let the good times roll!
